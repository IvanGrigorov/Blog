                            <p class="card-text">I am a young man, who is interested in the IT field. My main
                                niche is the software development. It started as a hobby at
                                first, but now I have around 5 years professional experience as
                                mobile and web developer and two years as a freelancer.
                                During that time I have gained serious knowledge in the
                                following software technologies and languages: PHP,
                                JavaScript, Java, NodeJs, DatabasesSQL and NoSql).
                                Alongside the process I finished several courses in Telerik
                                Academy by Progress, where I came into touch with C#. I
                                dedicate lots of my free time into learning mobile development
                                - Java for Android, Swift for iOS and Nativescript. I also gained
                                serious passion into atificial intelligence while studying Data
                                Knowledge courses like Machine Learnining and Information
                                Retrieval in Germany. I am also interested in creating games
                                using Unity 3D game engine.

                            <p class="card-text">Ten years ago it all startetd with a clip in Youtube about cosmology. 
                                Since then couple of books and lots of documentaries later it stills remain my passion.
                                It widened my horizon and showed me how interesting the science can be. 
                                Now I am getting my hands into structures, formal systems and some ever repeating loops.
                                In the end I have to say that here you can see some sport and travelling articles as these are my other interests.</p>
